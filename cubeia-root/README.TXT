Cubeia Root is a configuration and documentation project, used as a root for
every other Cubeia project.

The doc folder contains compact and concise documentation about requirements
for Cubeias projects, e.g. code-style etc., things that usually do not change
much.

STATUS: early draft.

TODO: this is a template, should be move to an own repository once ready.
