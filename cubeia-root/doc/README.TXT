TODO: choose document format (if not simple .TXT)

(this document should be authored by one person, taking in account comments of 
the team)

STATUS: early draft

CODE
====

* Use tab4, filled with spaces
* Use java-doc, even for simple methods, thus IDE assistance works
* Clarify status of of code (draft, alpha, beta, ...)
* Prefer to write down quick thougts as a TODO comment, then to loose them.
* Document any unusual programming, thus next developer does not try to fix.
* Place status of method and TODO into java-doc.


MAVEN
=====

* Use package, install and assembly in a standard way.
* Avoid the usage of "war-name", specifying alternate war-names.
* Avoid excessive usage of plugins.
* Keep builds free of warning messages (solve early)
* Keep projects free of dependency problems (solve early)
