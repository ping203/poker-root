This module contains a simple utility for creating new poker
users with Cubeia Netwirk. This is particulary useful for scripting. 

BUILDING
========
Run this command from the module root:

  `mvn clean package assembly:single`

This will create a JAR file in "target/" which is runnable
and contains all dependencies. 

RUNNING
=======
To create a user with user name "test" and password "pass" 
and default values copy the compiled JAR file above to the 
machine running you Cubeia Network installations, and run:

  `java -jar <jar file> -u test -p pass`

In order to see all options, run:

  `java -jar <jar file>`

SCRIPTING
=========
Finally, to create a batch of users you can use scripts. 
For example, to create 300 bots on a Cubeia Network installation, 
you can run this (if you're on a Linux system):

  `for i in {1..300}; do java -jar <jar file> -u Bot_$i -p $i; done`
