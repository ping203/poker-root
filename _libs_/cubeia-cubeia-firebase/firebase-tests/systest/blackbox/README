FIREBASE SYSTESTS
=================

Welcome to the Firebase integrations tests. 


RUNNING VIA ANT
===============
The ant script only works on *nix hosts. You need the following
prerequisites to run it successfully:

 * MAVEN_HOME must be set, eg "export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/mvn"
 * The ZIP release you want to test must be build locally

Configuration:

 * To test EE (as opposed to CE): -Dtype=EE
 * To test a specific version, eg 1.9.5: -Dversion=1.9.5

The following ant targets are useful to know:

 * 'ant' - start Firebase and runs all tests 


RUNNING FROM IDE / MAVEN
========================
These tests can be run via Maven or via your favorite IDE as long
as it supports TestNG. 

Prerequisites:

 * You need a Firebase running with these modules deployed...

 ** ../game
 ** ../service
 ** ../service-proxy 
 ** ../tournament

 * ... and also the configuration found in "src/test/resources"

These are some helpful parameters:

  "clientHost" - Client host to connect to, defaults to "localhost"
  "clientPort" - Client port to connect to, defaults to "4123"
  "activatorHost" - JMX host to connect to, defaults to "localhost"
  "activatorJmxPort" - JMX port to connect to, defaults to "8999"
  "lobbyHost" - Lobby host to connect to, defaults to "localhost"
  "lobbyJmxPort" - JMX port to connect to, defaults to "8999"
  "connectorType" - SOCKET | WEB_SOCKET | COMETD
  
Some note on the above: The "activator" parameters points to the server 
running the game activator, and this is used to create/destroy tables as well
as set-up tests. The "lobby" parameters are used to create a JMX connection
to a lobby server for evaluating lobby data. 

Normally, "lobby" and "client" are on the same server, so for a cluster where
A, B and C and client nodes, and D, E, F are game/mtt nodes, you would run the 
tests from using Maven like so:

  mvn clean package -DclientHost=A -DactivatorHost=D -DlobbyHost=A
  
You can also add security via system parameters. To use encryption, set
*one* of the following to 'true':

  firebase.systest.ssl
  firebase.systest.naive-ssl
  firebase.systest.native
  
In order to enable a hand shake with signature, set the signature in the
following system property:

  firebase.systest.handshakeSignature
