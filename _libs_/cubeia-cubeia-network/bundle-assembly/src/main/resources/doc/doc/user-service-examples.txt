INTRODUCTION

This document lists some examples of how to use the Cubeia Network User Service REST JSON API from the command line
using curl.

Curl can be downloaded here: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html. For Windows cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) is recommended.

TIP: If you have Python 2.6 or later installed you can format the json results by piping the output of the commands to:
"python -mjson.tool".

      "city" : "Stockholm",
      "country" : "Sweden"
    }
