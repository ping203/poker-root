The standard web client, HTML5 based.

This client is under active development.

To start:
mvn package jetty:run

Access:
http://localhost:8181


LOGIN
=====

Use any username and any integer as password (best: user integers > 1000 to not 
collide with test bots).

If you have already integrated with Cubeia Network, use the credentials provided
at Cubeia Network.

TESTING
=======

In order to test the client quickly, login from 2 different browsers. Then sit
the 2 players at one table and buy-in. The game starts.

Alternatively you can login from a 2nd networked machine or device, using the ip
of your main machine, e.g. http://192.168.1.13:8181.
