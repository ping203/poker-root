/**
 * A registry for returning timing definitions.
 * <p/>
 * A Timing is a set of predefined pause/waiting times between
 * events in the game. E.g. waitperiod between last call to new cards are
 * dealt.
 * <p/>
 * My intentions are that we should eventually support different
 * sets of waiting period. This way we could support slow and express
 * tables, the difference is just what timing profile they use.
 * <p/>
 * Currently I am only using a default definition. This is hardly
 * a prioritized task atm, but I think it nice to have a well defined
 * interface so it wont be such a pain to implement different time
 * profiles later on.
